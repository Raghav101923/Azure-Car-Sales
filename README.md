# Azure-Car-Sales

## üìã Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data engineering pipeline for processing and analyzing car sales data using modern Azure technologies. The focus is on building a scalable and efficient workflow for data ingestion, transformation, and reporting. The ultimate goal is to derive actionable insights from the data to support business decisions.

### Technologies and Tools Used

- **Azure Data Factory (ADF)**: For data ingestion and orchestration.
- **Azure Data Lake Gen2**: For efficient storage of raw and transformed data.
- **Azure Databricks**: For data transformation and analytics using Apache Spark.
- **Azure Synapse Analytics**: For data warehousing and analytical processing.
- **Power BI**: For creating dashboards and visualizing insights.

## üõ† Data Architecture

### Workflow Overview

The project workflow consists of the following components:

1. **Data Source**:
   - The car sales data is sourced from a SQL database.
   - Data is stored in raw format and ingested via Azure Data Factory.

2. **Data Ingestion**:
   - Raw data is ingested into Azure Data Lake Gen2 using ADF pipelines.
   - Provides scalability and cost-efficiency for storing raw and incremental data.

3. **Data Transformation**:
   - Transformation is performed using Azure Databricks with Apache Spark.
   - Steps include cleaning, aggregating, and structuring data into a unified schema.

4. **Data Serving**:
   - The transformed data is stored in Delta Lake and further processed into star schema tables.
   - Data is then loaded into Azure Synapse Analytics for advanced analytics and reporting.

5. **Reporting**:
   - Power BI connects to Synapse Analytics to create interactive dashboards for insights.

## üîç Detailed Workflow

### 1. Data Ingestion

- **Pipeline**:
  - Azure Data Factory pipelines manage the ingestion process.
  - Incremental loading is implemented using watermarks to track changes in the source data.

- **Storage**:
  - Raw data is stored in Azure Data Lake Gen2 in Parquet format for optimal storage and retrieval.

### 2. Data Transformation

- **Databricks**:
  - PySpark is used for distributed processing and big data transformations.
  - Data is structured into silver and gold layers to standardize and prepare data for analytics.

- **Real-Time Examples**:
  - Cleaned and aggregated car sales data.
  - Created dimensional tables like `Dim_Branch`, `Dim_Date`, and `Dim_Dealer`.
  - Built fact tables such as `Fact_Sales` for analytics.

### 3. Data Serving

- **Delta Lake**:
  - Finalized data is stored in Delta format for enhanced performance and ACID transactions.

- **Azure Synapse Analytics**:
  - Data is loaded into Synapse for creating external tables and querying using SQL.

### 4. Reporting

- **Power BI Dashboards**:
  - Data insights are visualized in Power BI, enabling data-driven decision-making.
  - Reports include sales trends, dealership performance, and customer demographics.

## üèÜ Highlights of Technologies

- **Azure Data Factory**: Simplifies ETL workflows with visual pipelines and monitoring.
- **Azure Data Lake Gen2**: Scalable and cost-efficient for big data storage.
- **Azure Databricks**: Unified analytics platform for big data transformation.
- **Apache Spark**: Distributed processing for large-scale data.
- **Azure Synapse Analytics**: Combines data warehousing and analytics into a single solution.
- **Power BI**: Delivers interactive and impactful dashboards for visualization.
